* gofer
This gofer is a fork of Mark Jones original with some additions and modifications, the most visible one being the /Dijkstra dot/ for function application. See [[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd13xx/EWD1300.PDF][Notational Conventions]] â€“ pg 8 onwards.

I used to call it /pugofer/ since I was using it to teach when at Pune University in the early 90s.

Mark Jones is gratefully acknowledged for this pioneering work.
* Setup
See [[file:INSTALL.org][installation/setup]]
* Sample
To see how source looks with these changed syntaxes, look at the standard prelude: [[file:pustd.pre][pustd.pre]].

The alternate prelude [[file:pusimple.pre][pusimple]] is particularly neat for those who feel the need to grok Hindley-Milner before getting into typeclasses. With that you'll get, for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
? :t (+)
(+) : Int -> Int -> Int
? :t (==)
(==) : a -> a -> Bool
#+END_SRC
* Syntax late-bound
You can switch back to classic Haskell syntax with =:s -S=
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
? map.(1+).[1,2,3]
[2, 3, 4] : [Int]

? :s -S
? map (1+) [1,2,3]
[2, 3, 4] :: [Int]

#+END_SRC
* Building
- =cd src=
- Choose the architecture near line 25 following  [[file:src/prelude.h][prelude.h]] \\
  Exactly one =LINUX=, =WIN32= or =NETBSD= (for MacOS) should be 1; all the rest should be 0
- If necessary, choose C compiler -- =CC= -- in [[file:src/Makefile][Makefile]] 
- =$ make= 
There is no configure to run.\\
Windows seems to build with mingw for 32 bit but not 64.
* Literature
Justifications for these changes are explained in [[http://www.the-magus.in/Publications/notation.pdf][Notes on Notation]]
