This directory contains minimal exe stuff for gofer on windows
[Thanks Sikander Tamboli for the compile]

gofer.exe of course on your path (or call with absolute path)

In addition you need to set the environment variable PUGOFER
to the path of the chosen prelude; eg
set PUGOFER=Z:/path/to/pusimple.pre
before calling gofer
